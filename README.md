## Overview

### The challenge

This Loopstudios landing page challenge focuses on implementing a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JS. The key objectives include:

- Providing an optimal layout across different screen sizes.

- Implementing hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

- Create a functional, accessible menu toggle that toggles between open and closed states, with a sliding navigation list panel for improved usability on mobile screens.

### Additional Features

To further test my SCSS and JS skills, I implemented a dynamic nav on scroll, which wasn't part of the original challenge. I added additional JS to change the appearance of the navbar when a user scrolls the page to improve user experience and practice working with JS for scroll-based interactions.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 – I structured my content with semantic elements, ensuring code clarity, readability, accessibility, and maintainability.

- BEM Methodology with Namespaces – I broke my page into Blocks, Elements, and Modifiers and utilized namespaces to distinguish components, utilities, and layout elements and create a modular, transparent, reusable, and scalable CSS architecture.

- Sass (SCSS syntax) – I used the SCSS syntax and incorporated partials and imports, variables, nesting, and parameterized mixins to create more modular, organized, flexible, scalable, maintainable, and dynamic stylesheets, while focusing on DRY coding practices.

- Mobile-first design – I focused on the core content, and prioritized optimal performance and usability on mobile devices before scaling up to larger screens in order to provide a consistent and seamless user experience across all devices.
